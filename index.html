							<h4 id="1.-Train-your-brain">1. Train your brain</h4>
							<p>“I like the widespread comparison of the brain with muscle that can be pumped up,” says cognitive neuroscientist Sahar Yousef. “It makes you feel like you're at the helm.” Inspires personally to become a designer of his brain. " This is possible due to neuroplasticity - the ability of the brain to change throughout life under the influence of various factors: our actions, experience, environment.</p>
							<p>For example, we can train attention through meditation and exercise. And thanks to this, then direct him in the right direction and stay focused for longer. Treat training such as going to the gym: the more often you exercise, the more your brain is pumped.</p>
							<h4 id="2.-Consider-your-inner-rhythms">2. Consider your inner rhythms</h4>
							<p>Someone is comfortable getting up at dawn and doing important things in the morning, others, on the contrary, only swing in the afternoon, and solve the main problems in the evening. Determine what time of day your brain functions best, and consider this when planning your work.</p>
							<p><em>To better understand your inner rhythms, keep a productivity diary for five business days.</em></p>
							<p>Every two hours, record how easy you worked and how you felt when you were energetic and when tired. After a few days, you will notice at what time your productivity grows and at what time it falls.</p>
							<h4 id="3.-Give-up-multitasking">3. Give up multitasking</h4>
							<p>“Many of my acquaintances no longer have a working day,” says Youssef. - There are short periods of time between meetings, calls and parsing mail. 15 minutes there, 30 or 45 minutes here. And in these periods they do what they were actually hired for: creative, mentally intense work, valuable to the company. ” This happens very often.</p>
							<p><em>We are constantly distracted from the main work by messages, notifications, requests and meetings.</em></p>
							<p>To preserve the ability to think critically and concentrate, Youssef advises a change in strategy. Allocate a certain time when you will check messages and respond to requests, and then no longer be distracted by them.</p>
							<p>If possible, build the day so that you have an hour or two of concentrated work without interruptions, and in between do less important things. Agree with colleagues that in case of something really urgent you can be contacted by phone.</p>
							<h4 id="4.-Create-new-associations">4. Create new associations</h4>
							<p>If you manage to work normally only in the mornings in the kitchen or in snippets in the meeting room, it’s as if you are telling your brain that your desk is the last place to complete work tasks. As a result, the table ceases to be associated with work, you are distracted by it.</p>
							<p><em>Think about the conditions under which you work best and protect them from unnecessary associations.</em></p>
							<p>“We have certain expectations of what actions and thoughts are associated with a particular place,” Yussef explains. Therefore, if you are sitting at a table and you want to get distracted (log in to social networks, look for something), get up and do it in another place. This is especially important for those who work remotely. Select a zone in which you perform only work tasks, and do not deal with them in other parts of the apartment. ”</p>
							<h4 id="5.-Take-care-of-the-brain">5. Take care of the brain</h4>
							<p>Thinking also depends on the physical state of the brain, so do not forget to follow it: drink enough water, eat well and move regularly so that blood rushes to the brain. Do not rely on coffee and sweets to quickly get a burst of energy. Snack something useful during the day, then there will be no sharp drops in productivity. And be sure to sleep enough.</p>
							<p>“One of my principles is that without“ outages ”you can't get“ on, ”says Youssef. - When you are at work, concentrate and use your brain. Treat him with respect, nourish and protect him. Then intentionally give yourself time to relax and disconnect from work. Do not absorb even more information, truly rest and recover. ”</p>
